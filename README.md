# Ubuntu + Wine VPS Setup on Replit (PC Only)

This repository contains a script to set up an Ubuntu VPS with Wine on Replit for running Windows applications. The script is designed for use on Replit and is intended for PC users.

**Warning: This is not a 24/7 VPS. However, if you have a method to make it 24/7 or have a premium Replit account, it is possible to make it 24/7.**

## How to Use on Replit

### Step 1: Create a Replit Project

1. Go to [Replit](https://replit.com/) and create a new project.
2. Choose "Python" as the template for your project.

### Step 2: Open the Replit Shell

Open the Replit shell by clicking on the "Shell" tab at the bottom of the screen.

### Step 3: Download the Script

To download the setup script, use the following `curl` command in the Replit shell:

```bash
curl -o main.py https://cdn-madkung-media.vercel.app/ubuntu-vps.txt
```

This command will download the script and save it as `main.py` in your Replit project. If a file named `main.py` already exists, it will be replaced with the new content.

### Step 4: Execute the Script

Run the script using the run button or the following command in the Replit shell:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Step 5: Follow On-Screen Instructions

The website will guide you.

## Requirements

- **Replit Account**: Ensure you have a Replit account and access to create a new project.
- **Python 3**: The Replit Python template comes with Python 3 pre-installed.
